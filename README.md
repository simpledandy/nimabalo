# 🌿 Nimabalo — Uzbek Q&A Platform

**Nimabalo** is an open, community-driven Q&A platform built for the Uzbek-speaking world.  
It’s where curiosity meets culture — a space for asking and answering meaningful questions about science, life, and art.

## 🌍 Vision

We’re creating a place for thoughtful Uzbek content — where ideas flow freely and respectfully.  
Nimabalo is open-source, educational, and collaborative:  
a real-world lab for learning full-stack development together.
