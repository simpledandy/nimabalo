- Use TypeScript and ESLint-friendly syntax.

  npm run dev
  ```

- Join repository discussions — ideas and questions help.
- Ask for feedback — we’re here to learn together.

## 🧭 Communication

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, suggestions, and questions.
- Be respectful and constructive — we’re building a culture of kindness and clarity.

## 🪞 Code of Conduct

- Be kind. Be curious.
- Disagreements are fine — disrespect isn’t.
